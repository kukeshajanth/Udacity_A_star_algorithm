# Udacity_A_star_algorithm

A* search to implement a "Google-maps" style route planning algorithm and find the shortest path between two points.

This project contains:

helpers.py - functions for loading and displaying the maps.

map-10.pickle -  map with 10 nodes.

map-40.pickle -  map with 40 nodes.

A*_algo_project_notebook.ipynb - Jupyter notebook that contains all the algorithm

test.py -  function for testing the route planner implementation.
